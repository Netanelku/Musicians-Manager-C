# Musicians Manager C
 As part of my programming course, I completed a project that involved building a system to manage orders for concerts. The system was designed to manage information about musicians and instruments, as well as orders for concerts.  To build the system, I used C programming language and incorporated file handling and pointers to make the program more efficient and robust. I designed a set of functions to model the different components of the system, such as musicians, instruments, and orders, and stored data in external files for ease of use.
